# Analyzing Mental Health in the Tech Industry Survey

## Introduction

Hello everyone, and happy International Mental Health Day! In celebration of this day, I've created this project to focus on analyzing the mental health of individuals in the tech industry and understand the factors that may lead to feelings of depression or the need for therapy.

I utilized a dataset from Kaggle, which originates from a 2014 survey that gauges attitudes towards mental health and the frequency of mental health disorders within the tech workplace. You can find the dataset attached to this repository for reference.

The dataset is rich in features, including:

- Timestamp
- Gender
- Country
- State (for U.S. residents)
- Self-employment status
- Family history of mental illness
- Seeking treatment for mental health conditions
- Work interference due to mental health
- Company size
- Remote work arrangement
- Employer's industry (tech or non-tech)
- Availability of mental health benefits
- Knowledge of mental health care options
- Inclusion of mental health in employee wellness programs
- Access to resources for mental health issues
- Anonymity protection for seeking help
- Ease of taking medical leave for mental health reasons
- Perceptions of discussing mental health with employers
- Perceptions of discussing physical health with employers
- Willingness to discuss mental health with coworkers and supervisors
- Willingness to discuss mental health in interviews
- Willingness to discuss physical health in interviews
- Comparison of mental health and physical health importance
- Awareness of consequences for coworkers with mental health conditions
- Additional comments and notes

## Analysis Steps

In this analysis, we follow these 7 key steps:

1. **Connecting Colaboratory to Google Drive**: Establishing the project environment.
2. **Importing Packages & Libraries**: Importing the necessary Python libraries for data analysis.
3. **Importing Data**: Loading the dataset for analysis.
4. **Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and content.
5. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
6. **Final Cleaned Data**: The cleaned dataset ready for deeper analysis.
7. **Gaining Insights**: Extracting meaningful insights from the data.

## Insights to Explore

Throughout the analysis, we'll delve into several key insights:
1. **Age Analysis**: Understanding the age distribution of survey respondents.
2. **Gender Analysis**: Analyzing the gender diversity within the tech industry.
3. **Demographic Analysis**: Exploring the geographic and cultural diversity of survey participants.
4. **Employee Awareness**: Investigating whether employees are aware of mental health programs in their companies.
5. **Employer Awareness**: Assessing whether employers are conscious of the mental health of their workforce.
6. **Comparison of Mental and Physical Health**: Comparing discussions about mental health and physical health in the office environment.
7. **Mental Health Consequences and Anonymity**: Examining potential adverse consequences related to mental health and the impact of anonymity.
