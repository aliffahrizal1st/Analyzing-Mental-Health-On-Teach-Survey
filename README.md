# Analyzing-Mental-Health-On-Tech-Survey

Hi everyone, and happy international mental health day! And because that day and as you probably know, I created this project to focus on analyzing the mental health of certain people to tell us what factors make a person feel depressed or need to see a therapist.
1. In this project I used [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey) from Kaggle. And it said "The dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace". I'll attached the file if you need it.
2. The dataset contains several features such as:
   - Timestamp
   - Gender
   - Country
   - state: If you live in the United States, which state or territory do you live in?
   - self_employed: Are you self-employed?
   - family_history: Do you have a family history of mental illness?
   - treatment: Have you sought treatment for a mental health condition?
   - work_interfere: If you have a mental health condition, do you feel that it interferes with your work?
   - no_employees: How many employees does your company or organization have?
   - remote_work: Do you work remotely (outside of an office) at least 50% of the time?
   - tech_company: Is your employer primarily a tech company/organization?
   - benefits: Does your employer provide mental health benefits?
   - care_options: Do you know the options for mental health care your employer provides?
   - wellness_program: Has your employer ever discussed mental health as part of an employee wellness program?
   - seek_help: Does your employer provide resources to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help?
   - anonymity: Is your anonymity protected if you choose to take advantage of mental health or substance abuse treatment resources?
   - leave: How easy is it for you to take medical leave for a mental health condition?
   - mentalhealthconsequence: Do you think that discussing a mental health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?
   - physhealthconsequence: Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?
   - coworkers: Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your coworkers?
   - supervisor: Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your direct supervisor(s)?
   - mentalhealthinterview: Would you bring up a mental health issue with a potential employer in an interview?
   - physhealthinterview: Would you bring up a physical health issue with a potential employer in an interview?
   - mentalvsphysical: Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?
   - obs_consequence: Have you heard of or observed negative consequences for coworkers with mental health conditions in your workplace?
   - comments: Any additional notes or comments
3. In this analysis process, there are 7 steps to be carried out
   1. Connecting Colaboratory to Google Drive
   2. Import Packages & libraries
   3. Import Data
   4. Initial EDA
   5. Data Cleaning
   6. Final Cleanded Data
   7. Gaining Insights
4. And there are some insights need to explore
   1. Age analysis
   2. Gender analysis
   3. Demographi analysis
   4. Are employees aware of the mental health program in their company?
   5. Is the employer aware of the mental health of its workers?
   6. Comparison when discussing mental health and physical health in the office environment
   7. Are there any adverse mental health consequences and would anonymity really help?
